## Tax Token (Token 2022) Pumpfun Smart Contract ‚öì
Pump.fun smart contract that works just like pump.fun, but with Token 2022 to support fee distribution to users and token creator. 
After hitting 100% bonding curve it is migrated to Raydium CPMM pool.

There are 2 types of contracts that I have developed, one that use SPL token and migrating to Raydium AMM (V4), and one that use token 2022 to support earning from fee and migrate to Raydium CPMM.

### Benefits of upgrated new Token 2022 Pump.fun smart contract compared to pump.fun
- The token creator and token holders get reward from tax fee from token itself, decreasing the possibility of rug pull by rewarding token creator not by pulling liquidity but by holding the token.
- CPMM pool creation does not need openbook market program, and costs much less to create pool, providing pool creator much more SOL and reduce loss when migrating to raydium.


In here, you can see the creation transaction, buy and sell transaction and withdraw transaction
